A screen reader is a form of assistive technology [1] that is essential to people who are blind, as well as useful to people who are visually impaired, illiterate, or have a learning disability.
Screen readers are software applications that attempt to convey what people with normal eyesight see on a display to their users via non-visual means, like text-to-speech,[3] sound icons,[4] or a Braille device.[5] They do this by applying a wide variety of techniques that include for example interacting with dedicated Accessibility API, using various operating system features (like inter-process communication and querying user interface properties) and employing hooking techniques.[6]
